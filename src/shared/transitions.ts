/**
 * Slide transitions for the Program Out window.
 *
 * Deliberately global rather than per-slide: a PDF carries no transition
 * metadata to attach anything to, and a presenter picks one look for a deck
 * and leaves it alone. One effect, one direction, one duration, applied to
 * every page change.
 *
 * **PDF sources only.** Keynote, PowerPoint, Google Slides and Canva bring
 * their own transitions, and running ours on top of theirs would double up on
 * whatever the deck's author already chose — so image-kind Program Out states
 * keep cutting (see ProgramOut.tsx).
 *
 * The presenter view is *not* transitioned either — the operator needs to see
 * the true current state with no lag, so Now/Next always cut.
 *
 * Kept in step with `pdf-presenter/src/shared/transitions.ts`, alongside
 * `pdf.ts`, which the two repos already share by copy.
