/**
 * Plays a transition between the slide currently on `canvas` and the one
 * `render` is about to draw there.
 *
 * The trick that makes this cheap: the *outgoing* slide is a plain pixel copy
 * of the canvas, taken before the render starts and laid over the top. Only
 * the copy and the live canvas ever move, so nothing here knows or cares that
 * the content came from pdf.js, and no second PDF render is needed to hold the
 * old slide on screen.
 *
 * It also composes with the double-buffering in pdf.ts (pdf-presenter issue
 * #28): the live
 * canvas keeps showing the old page until its render finishes, so the incoming
 * layer is put into its start state *before* the render is awaited and there is
 * never a frame where a half-drawn or blank page is visible.
