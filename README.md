The presentation laptop companion app for
[presentation-commander-server](https://github.com/allansargeant/presentation-commander-server).
A bespoke PDF presentation engine built as an Electron + React + TypeScript
desktop app — no PowerPoint or Keynote dependency.

## What it does

- **Bespoke PDF engine** — open a PDF, get Now/Next slide previews rendered
  locally with pdf.js
- **Presenter notes** — per-slide notes, auto-saved to a `.notes.json`
  sidecar file next to the PDF
- **Transport** — Previous/Next buttons and arrow-key navigation
- **Program Out** — a second, fullscreen, chrome-free window showing just
  the current slide, for a projector or confidence monitor. Pick which
  connected display it opens on from a dropdown next to the button
- **Server link** — connects to the Master Server's client hub over
  WebSocket (`ws://<host>:9800`), registers itself by name, pushes live
  slide/notes state, and accepts remote next/previous-slide commands
  triggered from the server's Control Surface
